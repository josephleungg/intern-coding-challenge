First need to create the table for the user's form data and then we can insert user's data into the table

CREATE TABLE formdata (
    fname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    province VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Since I used javascript for both frontend and backend, I would most likely use a SQL library such as mysql2
and use the body JSON data for the insert values. I would also hash the password first like how I did in
server.js to make it more secure

INSERT INTO formdata (fname, lname, email, password, phone, address, city, country, province)
VALUES (req.body.fname, req.body.lname, req.body.email, req.body.password, req.body.phone, req.body.address, req.body.city, req.body.country, req.body.province)

Example form data that would be submitted and inserted

INSERT INTO formdata (fname, lname, email, password, phone, address, city, country, province)
VALUES ('Joseph', 'Leung', 'leung.joseph2@gmail.com', 'test123', '4163889088', '123 address', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'Ontario');
